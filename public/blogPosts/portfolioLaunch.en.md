# Launch of the portfolio page ðŸŽ‰

Hello everyone, welcome to my portfolio page. I created it using ReactJS, mostly due to my familiarity with it and generally
enjoying the component based nature of it. This page will mainly serve as a professional website to introduce me and my works to potential
recruiters, and also where I will be posting my blogs. But don't count too much on it, god know I barely have any free time 
with my coursework, so I won't be posting too often. But I can tell you what I am planning on in terms of future projects.

## 1. Gameboy Emulator

I was always a big fan of emulator myself, having play a ton of PokÃ©mon games on GBA and NDS emulators. And last month, 
something clicked inside my head, I really want to build one myself. It will be a good learning opportunity on how computer
architecture work at a low level and provide a clear end goal, run a GB game successfully. I picked the **Gameboy** due to its
relative simplicity compared to other systems and tons of documentation online, and **C++** as the choice of language for mostly nostalgia reason
as it is my second ever language, first being Pascal. It does not mean that it won't be hard though, honestly it will probably take a year, 
possibly even more for me to complete it while managing school work and other projects.

## 2. Portfolio 2nd Edition

Even though I completed my portfolio, I feel the page itself is a bit generic and could be developed more. That why I am 
planning to build a second version of the portfolio, one that is more fun and creatively fulfilling at least for me. Currently,
I envision it to be RPG-like where player can go and explore various aspect of my portfolio, basically a more interactive version
of what the website currently have now. I will be researching into [**Phaser**](https://phaser.io/) for this project.

## 3. Rubber Duck Object Recognition and Defence System

This project is fueled by three motivations. First is to explore the world of deep learning to build an image recognition model,
as I already learned the basic of Machine Learning and Deep Learning through courses. Second is to try out embedded programming to apply the model 
to shoot Nerf bullet at a rubber duck. It mostly boiled down to me wanting to learn embedded programming and finding a way to incorporate it.
Finally is due to my extreme hatred of rubber duck. I believe rubber duck to be inferior to actual duck, which I held the belief of being the most majestic creature
of nature. And yet despite that people vastly prefer rubber duck to actual duck. Absolutely unacceptable! Admittedly among other projects,
this one is probably the most clueless I've ever been on where to start, but I'm sure my hatred for rubber duck will carry me through the process. Trust me
on that!

Thanks for sticking around and reading all of this. If you have any need of creating a new website and need someone to do it,
you can contact me either directly through email or go to the **Contact** page to send me a form. 

ByeeeeðŸ‘‹!
